  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

  Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration.

## üõ† Installation

``` cmd
git clone https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/TaylorSeer.git
```


## TaylorSeer-FLUX

TaylorSeer achieved a lossless computational compression of 4.99$\times$ and a Latency Speedup of 3.53$\times$ on FLUX.1-dev, as measured by [ImageReward](https://github.com/THUDM/ImageReward) for comprehensive quality. To run TaylorSeer-FLUX, see [TaylorSeer-FLUX](TaylorSeer-FLUX.md).

## TaylorSeer-HunyuanVideo

TaylorSeer achieved a computational compression of 5.00 $\times$ and a remarkable Latency Speedup of 4.65 $\times$ on HunyuanVideo, as comprehensively measured by the [VBench](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench) metric. Compared to previous methods, it demonstrated significant improvements in both acceleration efficiency and quality. To run TaylorSeer-HunyuanVideo, see [TaylorSeer-HunyuanVideo](TaylorSeer-HunyuanVideo.md).

## TayorSeer-DiT

TaylorSeer achieved a lossless computational compression of 2.77 $\times$ on the base model DiT, as comprehensively evaluated by metrics such as FID. Its performance across various acceleration ratios significantly surpassed previous methods. For instance, in an extreme scenario with a 4.53 $\times$ compression ratio, TaylorSeer's FID only increased by 0.33 from the non-accelerated baseline of 2.32, reaching 2.65, while ToCa and DuCa exhibited FID scores above 6.0 under the same conditions. To run TaylorSeer-DiT,see [TaylorSeer-DiT](TaylorSeer-DiT.md).
